# CoherentDualCore

Final project of ECE 404 - Multiprocessor Architecutres

Work in progress.

Implementation of cache coherence, in a dual core, MIPSfpga verilog simulation.
Private, local l1 instruction and data caches, global l2 cache.
Coherence through bus based, snooping flavor of MSI cache coherence.
